# fair-dice-roller

Web application for a dice game using the provably fair method. Players roll a dice with outcomes determined by a combination of a server-generated seed and player input. The server seed is hashed and shared with the player at the start, and revealed after the game for fairness verification. The application should be user-friendly and visually appealing.
